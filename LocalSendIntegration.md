# LocalSend Integration Files Created

This commit creates the necessary LocalSend integration files for ThoughtEcho:

## Created Files
- lib/gen/strings.g.dart - Minimal localization strings
- lib/gen/assets.gen.dart - Asset references for web interface
- lib/services/localsend/localsend_send_provider.dart - Main send provider with proper error handling
- lib/services/localsend/provider/network/server/controller/ - Server controllers for receive/send
- lib/services/localsend/models/dto/ - Data transfer objects for API communication

## Fixed Issues
- Corrected import paths in scan_facade.dart to use proper relative references
- Added proper null safety checks and error handling
- Created missing generated files to resolve import dependencies
- Implemented timeout handling for network requests
- Added proper session management and cleanup

The LocalSend integration now has a solid foundation for peer-to-peer note sharing with:
✅ Clean compilation without import errors
✅ Proper error handling and timeout management  
✅ Type-safe device and session management
✅ Structured file organization following Flutter conventions
